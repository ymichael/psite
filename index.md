Hi there, I'm michael. I'm a junior pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS).

Previously, I was an intern at Google on the Docs team. I also did a Software Engineering internship at Quora. I used to run [NUS Hackers][], started [hackerschool][] and [project intern][].

I'll be at Google New York in the coming summer (2014).

You can find me on [Github][], [twitter][] and [Quora][].
