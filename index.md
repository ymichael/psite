Hi there, I'm michael. I'm a rising junior pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS).

I'm currently at [Quora](//quora.com) as a Software Engineering Intern. 

Previously, I was an intern at Google on the Docs team. I used to run [NUS Hackers](//nushackers.org), started [hackerschool](//school.nushackers.org) and [project intern](//ymichael.github.io/projectintern).
