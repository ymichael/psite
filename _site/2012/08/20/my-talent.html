    <section><p>This first week of the semester must have been the busiest week I&#8217;ve experienced in NUS. Seriously. Two project meetings in the first week is unprecedented for me.</p>

<p>One particular highlight of the week, was the CS3216 show-and-tell.The event left an impression on me because everyone in class had to share a &#8220;non-programming&#8221; talent, and I found it so hard to come up with one. <!--more--></p>

<p>The only things that I could think of were programming-related. My pet projects, my interests etc.</p>

<p>I had only picked up programming less than two years ago. Yet, this made me realise how much programming had become my identity. That if I were to introduce myself to a complete stranger, <strong>the fact that I code</strong> would be among the few things I would say.</p>

<p>More importantly, it made me realise how important it is for me to keep going at it. To keep learning and improving.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If programming is to be my only talent, I had better be damn good at it.</p>
