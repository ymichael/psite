<div class="post">
	<p>A question that keeps coming up regarding <a href='http://modivle.yrmichael.com'>MODIVLE</a> is why I&#8217;m doing it and what made me do it.</p>

<p>Well, here it is:</p>

<h2 id='what_happened'>What happened</h2>

<h3 id='27_march_2012'>27 March 2012</h3>

<p>There was a wave of <a href='https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!searchin/nushackers/ivle/nushackers/9vBDb097xfY/H42RzUtu2sYJ'>IVLE fever</a> going around the <a href='http://nushackers.org'>NUS Hackers&#8217;</a> google groups. My friend <a href='https://twitter.com/div_arora'>@div_arora</a> basically made a <a href='https://github.com/darora/IVLE-Fix'>chrome extension</a> that used Twitter&#8217;s Bootstrap to <em>re-skin</em> IVLE. To be honest, I was impressed, but more than that, it made me realise how much better IVLE could look.</p>

<h3 id='28_march_2012'>28 March 2012</h3>

<p>After forking @div&#8217;s chrome extension and mucking around with IVLE&#8217;s DOM, I realise that the a browser extension wasn&#8217;t going to cut it. I looked up the <a href='http://wiki.nus.edu.sg/display/ivlelapi/IVLE+LAPI+Overview'>IVLE&#8217;s API</a> which I had previously heard of but never bothered to look up and started reading up on it. I decided to write a <a href='https://github.com/ymichael/ivleapi'>javascript wrapper</a> for the API not very sure what it would be used for.</p>

<h3 id='30_march_2012'>30 March 2012</h3>

<p>During the CS2100 lecture, I showed my friends what I had been working on. Nothing interesting happened here except that the I realised I should do something useful with the data after pulling it from IVLE.</p>

<p><em>I reached home after the lecture. It had been a long day. I didn&#8217;t feel like doing any work. I decided to continue working on MODIVLE.</em></p>

<p>Roughly 8 hours later, I had a working dropbox-like interface for IVLE&#8217;s workbin. I immediately posted it on the <a href='https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!searchin/nushackers/ivle/nushackers/O90iO6D-do4/WKYMJCu-8S4J'>google group</a>.</p>

<h2 id='motivation'>Motivation</h2>

<p>The truth is, when I first started this project, I didn&#8217;t know what I wanted to do. I was inspired by IVLE-fix and was bored. So I played around with the API for fun.</p>

<p>In the period time since, a lot has changed. I now have a clearer picture of what I want MODIVLE to do, and the direction I want it to take.</p>

<p>Most importantly, people are using it now. <strong>This is my motivation. To continue iterating on this application. To make it better. To make people happier. Even if its just by a little.</strong></p>

<h2 id='moving_forward'>Moving Forward</h2>

<p>MODIVLE is not finished. It probably never will be.</p>

<p>I have some features I hope to get in soon <em>(if time permits)</em>. Like file uploads and forum writes but thats not why its not finished.</p>

<p>Ideally, I&#8217;m hoping that MODIVLE outlives my time in NUS. This is the reason why it has been <a href='https://github.com/ymichael/modivle'>open sourced</a> from day one. I&#8217;m hoping that it&#8217;ll eventually evolve into something more. Something more than a single person.</p>
