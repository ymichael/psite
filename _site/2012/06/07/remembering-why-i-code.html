	<p>I bought this <a href='http://yrmichael.com'>domain</a> about 2 months ago. It was intended to be a personal site of sorts, to make it easier for me to share the stuff I build.</p>

<p>Yet, for some reason, I never got round to making my personal site. (Till now.) Well, I could attribute this delay to my finals and being busy with other stuff. But the truth is, I didn&#8217;t really want to. I procrastinated. I was lazy.</p>

<p>I was afraid of being judged. That once I made something, it would define me. More so a personal site. As a result, I simply set my nodejs server to respond to any http requests with the request object.</p>

<p>This was what visitors would see:</p>

<p><img alt='worst than crappy page' src='/img/blog/oldsite.jpg' /></p>

<p>If a crappy personal site was bad. This just screams &#8220;I can&#8217;t be bothered to write some markup, so here is something completely useless.&#8221;</p>

<p>When you donâ€™t create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability. Your tastes only narrow and exclude people. so create. <footer>- <cite>_why the Lucky Stiff</cite></footer></p>

<p>So here it is. Me doing better. Me reminding myself of the joys of coding. The reasons that I started to code in the first place.</p>

<p>Keep hacking.</p>
