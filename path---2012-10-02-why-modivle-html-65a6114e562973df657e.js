My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/div_arora">@div_arora</a> basically made a <a href="https://github.com/darora/IVLE-Fix">chrome extension</a> that used Twitter\'s Bootstrap to <em>re-skin</em> IVLE. To be honest, I was impressed, but more than that, it made me realise how much better IVLE could look.</p>\n<h3>28 March 2012</h3>\n<p>After forking @div\'s chrome extension and mucking around with IVLE\'s DOM, I realise that the a browser extension wasn\'t going to cut it. I looked up the <a href="http://wiki.nus.edu.sg/display/ivlelapi/IVLE+LAPI+Overview">IVLE\'s API</a> which I had previously heard of but never bothered to look up and started reading up on it. I decided to write a <a href="https://github.com/ymichael/ivleapi">javascript wrapper</a> for the API not very sure what it would be used for.</p>\n<h3>30 March 2012</h3>\n<p>During the CS2100 lecture, I showed my friends what I had been working on. Nothing interesting happened here except that the I realised I should do something useful with the data after pulling it from IVLE.</p>\n<p><em>I reached home after the lecture. It had been a long day. I didn\'t feel like doing any work. I decided to continue working on MODIVLE.</em></p>\n<p>Roughly 8 hours later, I had a working dropbox-like interface for IVLE\'s workbin. I immediately posted it on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!searchin/nushackers/ivle/nushackers/O90iO6D-do4/WKYMJCu-8S4J">google group</a>.</p>\n<h2>Motivation</h2>\n<p>The truth is, when I first started this project, I didn\'t know what I wanted to do. I was inspired by IVLE-fix and was bored. So I played around with the API for fun.</p>\n<p>In the period time since, a lot has changed. I now have a clearer picture of what I want MODIVLE to do, and the direction I want it to take.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, people are using it now. <strong>This is my motivation. To continue iterating on this application. To make it better. To make people happier. Even if its just by a little.</strong></p>\n<h2>Moving Forward</h2>\n<p>MODIVLE is not finished. It probably never will be.</p>\n<p>I have some features I hope to get in soon <em>(if time permits)</em>. Like file uploads and forum writes but thats not why its not finished.</p>\n<p>Ideally, I\'m hoping that MODIVLE outlives my time in NUS. This is the reason why it has been <a href="https://github.com/ymichael/modivle">open sourced</a> from day one. I\'m hoping that it\'ll eventually evolve into something more. Something more than a single person.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Why MODIVLE",date:"02 October, 2012"},fields:{slug:"/2012/10/02/why-modivle.html"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2012/10/02/why-modivle.html"}}}});
