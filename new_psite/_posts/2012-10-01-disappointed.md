Building Coffee proved to be a great learning experience. **I learnt so much.**

I learnt about [server management](https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite). I learnt about [offlining an application](http://blip.tv/jsconf/jsconf2012-jake-archibald-appcache-douchebag-6143723). I learnt about [the importance of data structures](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/163185/torvalds-quote-about-good-programmer) while trying to implement, albeit unsuccessfully, _a recursively defined list of lists_. 

Interestingly, I also learnt _[coffee](http://coffeescript.org)_.

Most importantly though, I learnt that **I need more training**. Not that I previously thought I didn't, but I thought I could pull off a todo list with much more ease than it took me, and with much more finesse than Coffee currently has.

I'm not particularly proud of Coffee. But the way I see it, this kick in the teeth is exactly what I need right now.

**I'm disappointed.** I want to be better. I need to work harder.

_Though I'm not sure what the lesson is exactly, I think I also learnt something about team dynamics. We could have done several things better, like communication for instance. This is not a trivial problem and I'm not going to make it seem so. I'll definitely be reflecting upon this._
