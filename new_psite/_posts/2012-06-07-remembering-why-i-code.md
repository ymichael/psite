I bought this [domain](http://yrmichael.com) about 2 months ago. It was intended to be a personal site of sorts, to make it easier for me to share the stuff I build.

Yet, for some reason, I never got round to making my personal site. (Till now.) Well, I could attribute this delay to my finals and being busy with other stuff. But the truth is, I didn't really want to. I procrastinated. I was lazy.

I was afraid of being judged. That once I made something, it would define me. More so a personal site. As a result, I simply set my nodejs server to respond to any http requests with the request object.

This was what visitors would see:

![worst than crappy page]({{ site.url}}/img/blog/oldsite.jpg)

If a crappy personal site was bad. This just screams "I can't be bothered to write some markup, so here is something completely useless."

So here it is. Me doing better. Me reminding myself of the joys of coding. The reasons that I started to code in the first place.

Keep hacking.
