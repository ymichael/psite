Hi there, I'm michael. I'm a software engineer at [Quora](//quora.com) on the
Platform Team.

I love coffee, food _(Yum chicken rice & pho)_ and reading about random things
on hackernews. In my free time, I follow the NBA and the TV shows that I've made
the mistake of starting.

Previously, I interned at Google on the Docs team. I also interned at Quora a
while back. I used to run [NUS Hackers][], started [hackerschool][] and [project
intern][].

You can find me on [Github][], [Twitter][] and [Quora][].
