Hi there, I'm michael. I'm a Singaporean ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ living in San Francisco. I'm currently a software engineer at [Figma][] on the editor platform team.

I enjoy a nice cup of coffee, snacking and learning random things.

Previously, I was at [Quora][] and before that I interned at Google on the Docs team. I used to run [NUS Hackers][], started [hackerschool][] and [project
intern][].

You can find me on [Github][] and [Twitter][].
