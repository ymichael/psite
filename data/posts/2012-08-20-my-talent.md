This first week of the semester must have been the busiest week I've experienced in NUS. Seriously. Two project meetings in the first week is unprecedented for me. 

One particular highlight of the week, was the CS3216 show-and-tell.The event left an impression on me because everyone in class had to share a "non-programming" talent, and I found it so hard to come up with one.

The only things that I could think of were programming-related. My pet projects, my interests etc.

I had only picked up programming less than two years ago. Yet, this made me realise how much programming had become my identity. That if I were to introduce myself to a complete stranger, **the fact that I code** would be among the few things I would say. 

More importantly, it made me realise how important it is for me to keep going at it. To keep learning and improving.
