So I spent 8 months away from home. I took a leave of absence from school, went
to the U.S for my internships`[1][2]`, and I'm right back where I was a year ago.

I'm in room doing school work, worrying about when the next test is, when the
next deadline is etc.

Well, not quite. To be honest, things have changed. I feel different. Different
in a good way I guess. I think my perspective on things changed somehow. I also
learnt a lot from my experience.


## Work is not everything

## Priorities

## Explore new things

## School is really just the beginning.
