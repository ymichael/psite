I can't believe that I'm done with my third year of college.

Time really flew by in the past year. I spent 8 months in the US doing back to back internships at Google and Quora, then came back to school and did an insane semester, overloading on classes to catch up with my peers.

I feel like I've changed a lot this past year. Here's a look back on some of the
things that happened in the last 12 months:

## Internships
I've blogged a little on my experience at
[Google](http://ymichael.quora.com/Week-4-at-Google) and
[Quora](http://ymichael.quora.com/First-Impressions-Quora) but they really don't
do justice to the amazing experience I had at both places. I learnt alot about
software engineering just from working with the other engineers, code reviews
and working on the existing systems built by great engineers.

During my internships, I also got to meet many amazing individuals. My mentors,
team members, other interns. It was a truly humbling experience in so many ways.


## Project Intern
During my spare time over there, I started
[project intern](//ymichael.github.io/projectintern). The idea was, having seen
the value of going for such internships, to encourage other students back in SoC
to do the same as well as provide more information about how to go about getting
one. So I got a couple of friends to chip in on a document to do just that. I'm
pretty please with the results so far seeing as how there seems to be more
people doing these internships this time around.

## An extremely packed semester
Last semester, I decided to take more modules than usual in order to graduate
together with my peers. I was behind from taking a semester off for my
Quora internship.

I took 7 modules in total. In addition, I tutored for CS2020. Which basically
meant that the last 4 months was an insane execise in time management.

In order for this to work, I could't afford to attend every single lesson, which
even though was possible, would mean very little time for actual studying and
learning of the content. I went for every single lesson the first week of school
to determine how useful they were before deciding on which I would attend and
which I could live without.

The other thing I did differently this semester, was to ignore participation
marks. Typically, some modules would encourage students to attend tutorials by
allocating a fraction of the final grade as participation, to be earned through
attendance and participation of tutorials. I only went for the classes if I
felt they were helpful (after the first time). *I'm still not sure how this
played out. I guess I'll know once the results for the semester comes out.*

## Graduating seniors
In the last few weeks of the semester,
