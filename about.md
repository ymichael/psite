Hi there, I'm michael. I'm a junior pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS).

Previously, I was an intern at Google on the Docs team. I also did a Software Engineering internship at Quora. I used to run [NUS Hackers](//nushackers.org), started [hackerschool](//school.nushackers.org) and [project intern](//ymichael.github.io/projectintern).

I'll be at Google New York in the coming summer (2014).
