Hi there, I'm michael. I'm a senior pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS).

Previously, I interned twice at Google on the Docs team. I also did a Software Engineering internship at Quora. I used to run [NUS Hackers][], started [hackerschool][] and [project intern][].

You can find me on [Github][], [Twitter][] and [Quora][].
