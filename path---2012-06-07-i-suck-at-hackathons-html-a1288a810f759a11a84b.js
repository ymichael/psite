There was great coffee, beer, food and above all, a great crowd. </p>\n<p>Sadly, I don\'t have anything to show for it.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>I started the event learning <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Haskell</a>. But I gave up once I hit <code>Functors</code> and <code>Monads</code>. I then set out to making a <a href="https://gemnasium.com">Gemnasium</a> clone for <code>nodejs</code> projects.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Gemnasium keeps you up to date on the gems that matter to you.\nWe parse your Ruby projectsâ€™ gem dependencies and notify you when new versions are released </p>\n</blockquote>\n<footer>- <cite>Gemnasium.com</cite></footer>\n<p>I proceeded to do the following: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>hooked up github\'s oath. </li>\n<li>retrieved a list of the authenticated user\'s repositories.</li>\n<li>checked each repo for a <code>package.json</code> file and/or a <code>node_modules</code> directory.</li>\n<li>for each relevant repository, detect the dependencies</li>\n<li>check their version against the npm registry.</li>\n<li>notify the user if and when any dependencies are outdated</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As it turns out, <code>rubygems</code> exposes a web hook which <code>npm</code> does not. However, the npm registry is hosted on couchdb which exposes a <a href="http://isaacs.iriscouch.net/registry/_changes?feed=continuous">"changes" feed</a>.</p>\n<p>Anyway, as I reached the last part, fatigue got the better of me and I stopped. Probably also due to the many unknowns that I hadn\'t figured out.</p>\n<p>As a result, I have nothing to show for #shdh. Nothing to show for the day\'s worth of "hacking". </p>\n<p>Many people would call this a failure. A waste of time. But I regret nothing. Neither do I see it as a failure. If anything it was a great experience. if I had to redo the entire thing, I probably do the same thing. </p>\n<p>In many ways, hackathons are like races. You spend time hacking in isolation (training) and come race-day, you pit your skills against other hackers and see how you fare against the playing field. </p>\n<p>Its a great time to get a sense of where you stand and perhaps, recalibrate your ego.</p>\n<p>I suck at hackathons but I like them anyway. Now back to training.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"I suck at hackathons",date:"07 June, 2012"},fields:{slug:"/2012/06/07/i-suck-at-hackathons.html"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2012/06/07/i-suck-at-hackathons.html"}}}});
