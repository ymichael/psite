> how do I make decisions?

For the better part of last week, I struggle with the above question. 

As I searched for the answer to the question, a part of me wanted it to be logical. That I made decisions based on logic, scientific and justifiable. That I made decision based on my values, not whim, the weather or some random number..

Yet, the truth is far from it. In fact, I'm not even sure I use the same decision making _algorithm_ each time.

Perhaps it is for the best. _(I comfort myself.)_ The unpredictable nature of my decision-making gives life more room for surprises (whether pleasant or unpleasant).

On the other hand, this lends itself to possibly making bad decisions, not that a logical decision making algorithm will always be right, but without it, you are always going to second guess yourself. _How/why did I decide to do this?_

To be honest, I'm still pondering this question as I write. I don't have an answer. I really should.
