For the first project assignment, my team is building a social network. Well, not quite. Think twitter's open nature built on Facebook's social graph minus identities. 

Meet Hush.

Initially, my team used twitter's awesome bootstrap library to bootstrap (I apologise for the poor play on words) our site. Primarily because we wanted to get it off the ground fast, focusing on the flow of the application rather than get bogged down by the nitty-gritty details of how every pixel should look.

This decision helped us to quickly push out features, and we soon reached a point where we needed to style the application. This was a point that I was dreading. Throughout the period of time we were coding the application, I constantly thought about how the application should look yet came up with nothing.

The main problem that I was having was the anonymous feature of our platform meant that posts lack the familiar balance of a user's profile picture or it's color for that matter. Any resulting UI I came up with looked bland at best, with the typography taking center stage. 

At one point, I even considered going to typekit to buy `Proximal Nova`.

Thankfully, while I was tinkering with the stylesheets of the site, a thought came to me. I realise that being bland not necessarily meant looking bad. In fact, it hinted at the anonymity that our platform embraces. I just had to find a right balance of negative space to match.

Surfing the web for more inspiration took me to `hackernews` and `lobsters`. And while neither are similar in function to Hush, both spoke to me as a user. Their simplistic plain designs allowed their content to be the main focus of their sites not the authors of these contents. This was exactly what I needed.

Here is what I came up with:

![endproduct]({{site.url}}/img/blog/mainpage.jpg)

![notifications]({{site.url}}/img/blog/notifications.jpg)

Maybe these designs don't look nice. Maybe I'm just thinking too much about the UI. Well, my excuse is that I'm not a _designer_. But I really like how they turned out. Comments and thoughts are most welcome!

Do check out [Hush](http://hush.sh). Its a work in progress but I'm sure you'll like it. :)
